			<h2 align="center">BIOGRAPHY</h2>
			<p align="center">Dumisa Mzwakali aka 'Demyza' is a 22 year old South African artist and entrepeneur that lives in the east of Johannesburg. Originally he is from a town known as Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape Province. He moved to Johannesburg after his final year of primary school. In 2010 he began his highschool career at a public school in Alberton. It was during this year he met a friend who was a DJ and started experimenting with music production software. In 2013 he transferred to a private school in Mbombela, Mpumalanga where he matriculated in the year 2014. In 2015 he went to study Civil Engineering in Hangzhou, China. During his second year of study, in 2017, he had a psychotic episode and was admitted to a Psych ward at one of the local Hangzhou hospitals until he recovered. He returned to South Africa and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. The following year he returned to China to continue with his studies but he had fallen behind and felt as though Civil Engineering was not the path that he was meant to take. Upon his return to South Africa in June 2018, he decided to follow his passion of being an artist, whether it be visual or musical. He applied to the a few Universities and submitted his portfolios and as he awaited results he was working on his music career. Before the end of the year he had been accepted to a few universities and decided that the University of Johannesburg would be the best fit for him since it was close to home and was the only one that offered the type of course that he really wanted. He began his studying a for a Degree in Multimedia Design in February 2019, released his debut EP in June of the same year and also started a company called Utopian Ideas in the same month. We hope to see many great things from this young man.</p>
