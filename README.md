# Demyza's Artist Website

This was the first website that i created to a certain level of "completion", Titled 'The Man Behind The Pomegranate'. I created this project between June 2019 - August 2019 using Adobe Dreamweaver, as a project for school as well as "almost" a portfolio to showcase my work

04/02/2021. The website is functional and i want to make it my offical portfolio for all my work.

06/02/2021. Completely stripped it. Created a new navigation bar, starting simple.
