#My Portfolio Website

This was the first website that i created to a certain level of "completion", Titled 'The Man Behind The Pomegranate'. I created this project between June 2019 - August 2019 using Adobe Dreamweaver, as a project for school as well as "almost" a portfolio to showcase my work but it never made it online.

It is now my working portfolio website.
